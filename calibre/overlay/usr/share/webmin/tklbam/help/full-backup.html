<header>Full Backup Frequency</header>

<p>A full backup is a backup that can be restored independently of any
other backup. A full backup will be performed if the last full backup is
older than the specified frequency. Between full backups, all backups
are incremental, saving only changes made since the previous backup.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>FREQUENCY := &lt;int&gt;[DWM]</p>

<p>'D' is for Days. 'W' is for Weeks. 'M' is for Months.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<pre>
  3D      three days
  2W      two weeks
  1M      one month
</pre>


<h3>Technical Implications</h3>

<p>Incremental backups are useful because they are fast and efficient.
But restoring an incremental backup requires retrieving the volumes of
all backup sessions made before it, up to and including the full backup
that started the chain. The longer the backup chain, the more time it
will take to restore.</p>

<p>Very long backup chains are inefficient and more vulnerable if
something goes wrong as links in the chain depend on one another.</p>

<p>If you backup daily, and do a full backup monthly, your backup chains
will consist of a full backup with at most 30 incremental backups linked
to it. If you backup more frequently (e.g., hourly) you may want to
reduce the full backup frequency to every few days.</p>
