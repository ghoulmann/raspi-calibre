<header>Skip Elements of the Restore Process</header>

<p>Check any of these options to skip entirely restoration of package management
state, changes to the filesystem or database contents. For more
selective control over the restoration process, use restore limits.</p>

<p>Remember, if you make a mistake you can rollback the last
restore and try again.</p>
