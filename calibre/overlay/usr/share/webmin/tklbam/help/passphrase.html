<header>SKPP - Secret Key Passphrase Protection</header>

<p>Backups are always encrypted with a unique secret key generated
locally on your server, whether or not you set a passphrase.</p>

<p>If you don't use passphrase protection, the secret key exchange is
managed transparently by the Hub over a secure SSL connection.</p>

<p>But for extra security, you can passphrase protect this secret key.
Then when you restore, you'll be asked for the passphrase which is used
to <a
href="http://www.turnkeylinux.org/blog/tklbam-backup-passphrase">cryptographically
unlock</a> the secret key used to encrypt the restored
backup.</p>

<p>So long as the backed up system is accessible, you can set a new
passphrase via the TKLBAM Webmin interface without needing to know the
old passphrase.</p>

<p>If you use passphrase protection, we recommend storing an escrow key
in a safe place to protect against data loss in case you forget the
passphrase and can't change it because the backed up system is lost
(e.g., hard disk crash or terminated EC2 instance).
