<header>Size of Backup Volumes</header>

<p>The size in megabytes of the encrypted volumes created by TKLBAM's back-end
Duplicity. The default is fine for most usage scenarios.</p>

<p>Slow and unreliable network connections may benefit from a lower volume
size. Amazon S3 doesn't support resuming partial uploads for a stored
object so if the network breaks during upload, Duplicity will restart
the upload for that backup volume.</p>
