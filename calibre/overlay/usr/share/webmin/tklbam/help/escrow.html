<header>Escrow Key</header>

<p>An escrow key, stored in a safe place, can protect against data
loss by allowing you to restore a backup even if you passphrase protect
the encryption secret and then forget the passphrase.</p>

<p>If you don't use passphrase protection, you don't need an escrow key.
Your data is still encrypted, but the key exchange is managed
transparently by the Hub.</p>

<h3>Forgotten your passphrase and don't have an escrow key?</h3>

<p>If the system you backed up is still available, you can set a new
passphrase in the TKLBAM Webmin interface without needing to know the
old passphrase.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if you've forgotten the passphrase and don't have an
escrow key nobody can help you. The encryption key for a backup is
generated locally on your server and we designed passphrase protection
to use <a href="http://www.turnkeylinux.org/blog/tklbam-backup-passphrase">special
cryptographic countermeasures</a> to make typical cracking techniques
(e.g., dictionary attacks) very difficult even for an attacker with
access to massive computer resources.

<p>Next time we recommend you save an escrow key somewhere safe or don't set a
passphrase.</p>
