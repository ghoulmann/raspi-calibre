<header>32-bit I/O support</header>
Set the (E)IDE 32-bit I/O support.<p>

This value works with nearly all 32-bit IDE chipsets, but incurs slightly more overhead.  Note that "32-bit" refers to data transfers across a PCI or VLB bus to the interface card only; all (E)IDE drives still have only a 16-bit connection over the ribbon cable from the interface card.
