<header>Keep features over reset</header>
Set the drive's <i>keep_features_over_reset</i> flag.<p>

Setting this enables the drive to retain the settings for <b>Read look-readahead</b>, <b>Reprogram best PIO mode</b>, <b>Standby timeout</b>, <b>Write caching</b> and <b>Transfert Mode</b> over a soft reset (as done during the error recovery sequence).<p>
Not all drives support this feature.
