<header>Transfer mode</header>
Set the IDE transfer mode for newer (E)IDE/ATA2 drives.<p>

This is typically used in combination with <b>Using DMA</b> when enabling DMA to/from a drive on a supported interface chipset.<p>

Apart from that, use of this flag is .I seldom necessary since most/all modern IDE drives default to their fastest PIO transfer mode at power-on.  Fiddling with this can be both needless and risky.<p>

<i>Use this with extreme caution!</i>
