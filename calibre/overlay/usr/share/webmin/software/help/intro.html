<h3>Introduction to Packages</h3>
A software package is a collection of files that make up a program. These
files may all be combined into one package file for distribution or
downloading, to be extracted and placed in their correct locations when
the package is installed. <p>

A package management system automates most of the work in installing and
deleting programs. Because packages are usually pre-compiled, you do not
have to worry about <tt>Makefiles</tt> and <tt>configure</tt> scripts when
installing. Because the package management system keeps track of all
packages, it can remove all trace of a program when uninstalling. <p>

<h3>Installed Packages</h3>
Packages are organised into classes and subclasses, like <tt>System</tt>
or <tt>X11/Utilities</tt>. At the top of the main page is a tree of folders
and packages, in which each folder represents a class. To open a folder, simply
click on it. To view more information about a package, click on its name. <p>

Below the package tree is a form for searching the package database. This
will search for packages whose name or description matches whatever text
you enter. <p>

<h3>Install a New Package</h3>
Below the package search button is a form for installing a new package.
You may install either from a file on your system, a file on the computer
on which you are running your web browser, or from an FTP or HTTP URL.
In the last case, Webmin will contact the FTP server or web site and download
the package file. If your system is behind a firewall, make sure you have
the proxy servers configured correctly in the <i>Webmin Configuration</i>
module. <p>

<h3>Identify a File</h3>
At the bottom of the main page is a form for identifying some file on
your system. You may enter either an absolute path like
<tt>/etc/inetd.conf</tt>, or a command like <tt>elm</tt>. Webmin will attempt
to find the file in the package management system, and display information
about the file and the packages that use it. <p>
