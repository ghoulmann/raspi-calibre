<header>Process multiple volumes?</header>

Choose this option if you want to enable the processing of
multi-volume CDs. The default is "Yes".
<br><br>
Processing software from CD-ROM source may require filesets stored on
other CD volumes. Setting this option to "Yes" allows filesets on 
other CD volumes to be processed during the same session. If you set
it to "No", even multi-volume CDs are seen as a single standalone CD,
and filesets on other CD volumes cannot be accessed.
