<header>Cleanup install failure?</header>

Cleans up after an interrupted installation and attempts to remove all
incomplete pieces of the previous installation. Cleanup should be performed
whenever any software product or update is in a state of either applying or
committing and can be run manually as needed. For backwards compatibility other
flags and parameters can be accepted with installp -C, but are ignored because
all necessary cleanup is attempted.
