<header>Check filesystem sizes?</header>

By default when <b>Yes</b> is selected, RPM will check the free space on
all mounted filesystems when installing a package, to ensure that it will
fit. However, if you have some filesystems mounted from down NFS servers,
you may want to select <b>No</b> instead, so that the package can actually
be installed. <p>
