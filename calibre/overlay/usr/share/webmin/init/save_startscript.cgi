# save_startscript.cgi
# saves modifications to the StartupItems/script/script or
# the StartupItems/script/StartupItems.plist

# Even though it would be MUCH faster to pass the file to be edited
# in the form, forms are filled out by the browser, not the server.
#
# A malicious user could manipulate the form to write to
# any file they darned well please. While a user who has webmin access 
# to the bootup scripts could do a fair amount of damage anyway, I still
# would rather limit the possible files the cgi will write to to the
# actual bootup scripts.

# Written by Michael A. Peters <mpeters@mac.com> for
# webmin init module, based on save_local.cgi of same
# module. Written for Darwin/OS X.
