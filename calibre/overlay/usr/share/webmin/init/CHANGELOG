---- Changes since 1.150 ----
On operating systems like FreeBSD and AIX that have a script which is run at system shutdown time, this script can now be edited. It will also be updated by the enable_at_boot and disable_at_boot functions to run any shutdown-time code for newly created actions.

---- Changes since 1.170 ----
Added buttons for starting and enabling actions at boot, and stopping and disabling.
