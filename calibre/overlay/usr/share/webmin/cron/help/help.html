<h3>Introduction</h3>
This module can be used to setup commands to be run automatically at
scheduled times. It uses the standard Unix <tt>cron</tt> daemon,
which can run commands as various users at selected minutes, hours, days
of the month, days of the week and months of the year. Every job is owned
by a user, and when executed runs with the permissions of that user. <p>

The module's main page lists all the known scheduled jobs, grouped by the
user to run as. Some systems will have jobs that are part of the
operating system, owned by users like <tt>root</tt> or <tt>sys</tt>.
There may also be jobs created by users on your system using the
<tt>crontab</tt> command, owned by the users who created them. <p>

<h3>Creating a New Scheduled Job</h3>
To create a new job, click on the <tt>Create new Scheduled Job</tt> below
the list of existing jobs. This will display a form for entering the
following parameters :
	<ul>
	<li><b>User to run as</b><br>
	    The login name of the Unix users the job will be run as. <p>
	<li><b>Active?</b><br>
	    If a job is not active, it will still be displayed in the list
	    of known jobs, but will not be run on schedule. <p>
	<li><b>Command</b><br>
	    The actual Unix command to run at the schedules time. This can
	    be any command that you would type at the command line. <p>
	<li><b>Input to command</b><br>
	    If this field is not empty, then whatever you enter will be
	    provided as input to the command when it is run. For example,
	    if the command was <tt>mail foo@bar.com</tt> and the input
	    <tt>hello world</tt>, then the input text would be emailed to
	    <tt>foo@bar.com</tt>. <p>
	<li><b>Times to run</b><br>
	    The times when a command is run are chosen by specifying the
	    minutes, hours, days of the month, months of the year and
	    days of week to run. For each of these you can either choose
	    <tt>All</tt>, or select the times when the command should be
	    run. <p>

	    For example, if you chose 5 for the hour and tuesday for the
	    day of the week then the command would be run every minute from
	    5:00am to 5:59am on tuesdays. <br>
	    Alternatively, if you chose 30 for the minute and 14 for the hour,
	    then the command would be run every day at 2:30pm. <p>
	</ul><p>
Once you have filled in the form, click on the <tt>Create</tt> button on
the bottom on the page. The new job will take effect immediately. <p>

<h3>Editing an Existing Scheduled Job</h3>
To edit an existing job, click on the command from the list of jobs
on the main page. The form for editing an existing job is the same as
the form for creating a new job, described above. One you have made
whatever changes are needed, click on the <tt>Save</tt> button at
the bottom of the page. <p>

To delete a job, click on the <tt>Delete</tt> button at the bottom
of the job editing form. This will immediately delete the job without
asking for confirmation. <p>
