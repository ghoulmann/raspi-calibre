<header>Process</header>

This field contains the command line of the program which should be executed
on the specified runlevel (e.g. /etc/init.d/rc, /sbin/getty...).<br>

If the process field starts with a `+' character, <i>init</i> will not do
utmp and wtmp accounting for that process. This is needed for gettys that
insist on doing their own utmp/wtmp housekeeping. This is also a historic
bug.<p>
