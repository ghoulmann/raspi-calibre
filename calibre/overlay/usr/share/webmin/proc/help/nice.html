<header>Nice Level</header>

Every process runs with a certain priority, called the nice level. A high
priority process will get more CPU time than those with lower priorities,
and thus appear to run faster. Changing the nice level only really makes
sense for CPU-intensive processes, as most programs spend almost all of
their time waiting for something (such as user input) and thus will not
benefit or suffer if their priority changes.
