<header>Using filesystem</header>

This search criteria finds processes that are using any file or directory
on the selected filesystem. If a process has a file open for reading or
writing or is in a directory on the chosen filesystem, it will be included
in the search results. This can be useful for finding processes that prevent
a filesystem from being unmounted.
