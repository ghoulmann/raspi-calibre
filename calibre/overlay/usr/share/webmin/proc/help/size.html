<header>Running Processes - Memory View</header>

This page shows all running processes, ranked by memory used. For each process
the PID, owner, size in kB and command are displayed. Click on the PID to
display more information about a running process. <p>

This view can be useful for finding which commands are using excessive amounts
of memory on your system. However, memory use can be misleadingly high for
processes like the X server which may include mapped frame buffers in
their memory utilization. Multiple instances of the same process (such as
<tt>httpd</tt> or <tt>bash</tt>) share much of their memory, making their
total utilization appear higher than it really is. <p>
