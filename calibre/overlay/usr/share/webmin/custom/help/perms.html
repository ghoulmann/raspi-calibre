<header>File permissions</header>

Two options are available here - you can either choose to leave the file
permissions as they are, or enter a 3-digit octal number representing
the permissions to set the file to after it is saved (the same format as
is used by the <tt>chmod</tt> command).
If a file does not exist and this option is not set, when it is created
its permissions will probably be something like <tt>644</tt>.
