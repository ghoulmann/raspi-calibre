<header>File ownership</header>

Two options are available here - you can either choose to leave the file
ownership as it is, or select a user and group who will be granted ownership
after saving. This option is most useful for newly created files.
If a file does not exist and this option is not set, when it is created
it will be owned by the user and group Webmin runs as (most likely
<tt>root</tt> and <tt>root</tt>).
