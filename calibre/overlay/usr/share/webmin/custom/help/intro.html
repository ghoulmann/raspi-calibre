<header>Custom Commands</header>

This module allows you to setup and execute commonly-used commands, with
optional parameter substitution. This can be useful if you want to make
commonly used scripts or programs easily executable from your browser or
easily available to inexperienced users. <p>

The main page displays one button for each defined command, with optional
parameters below each button. You can execute the command simply by selecting
the appropriate options and clicking on the button, whereupon the output
from the command will be displayed. <p>

To edit an existing command, just click on the <tt>Edit command</tt> link
below it. To create a new command, click on the <tt>Create a new custom
command</tt> link at the bottom of the page. Note that these options may not
be available to all Webmin users. <p>
