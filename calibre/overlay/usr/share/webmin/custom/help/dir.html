<header>Run in directory</header>

By default, the specified command will run in the directory containing this
Webmin module's programs, which will be something like
<tt>/usr/libexec/webmin/custom</tt>. This option can be used to specify a
different directory, which can be useful for avoiding the need to use full
paths for the command and its parameters. <p>
