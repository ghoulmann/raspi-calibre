This module can also be used to setup buttons for editing frequently-edited
files. This can also be useful if you want to grant some untrusted user
the rights to edit only a few files. <p>

Like the command buttons, the main page will also display one button for each
defined file editor. To edit an existing editor, just click on the <tt>Edit 
file editor</tt> link below it. To create a new editor, click on the
<tt>Create a new file editor</tt> link at the botton of the page. <p>
