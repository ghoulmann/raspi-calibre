<header>Maximum time to wait for command?</header>

When this field is set to <b>Forver</b>, the module will wait indefinately
for a custom command to complete. However, if you enter a number of seconds
the command will be terminated after that time elapses. This can be useful
for getting rid of hanging processes. <p>
