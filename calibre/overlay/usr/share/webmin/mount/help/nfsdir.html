<header>Directory to mount</header>

This is the directory exported by the NFS server which will be mounted on your host.<br>
The button displays the list of the directories exported by the server.<br>
For NFSv4, you should always mount '/' which is the pseudofilesystem exported by the server. All the available exported directories are in this pseudofilesystem.
