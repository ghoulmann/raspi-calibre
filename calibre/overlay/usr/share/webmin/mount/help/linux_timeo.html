<header>Timeout</header>

The value in tenths of a second before sending the first retransmission after an RPC timeout.<br>
After the first timeout, the timeout is doubled after each successive timeout until a maximum timeout of 60 seconds is reached.<br>
Better overall performance may be achieved by increasing the timeout when mounting on a busy network, to a slow server or through several routers or gateways.<br>
