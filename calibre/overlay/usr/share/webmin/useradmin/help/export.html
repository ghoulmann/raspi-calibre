<header>Export Batch File</header>

This page can be used to export some or all of the users on your system as
a batch file usable with the modules <b>Create, modify and delete users from
batch file</b> feature. This can be useful if you want to migrate users
to another system, or create a backup of the user database on this system.
<p>
The fields on this forn are :
<dl>
<dt><b>Batch file destination</b>
<dd>This field simply determines if the resulting file will be displayed on screen, or saved to a file on the server. <p>

<dt><b>Batch file format</b>
<dd>This menu determines which format will be used for 
the resulting batch file, with your system's format selected. If you are
creating a batch for use on a system running a different OS, then the format
suitable for that OS should be selected. <p>

<dt><b>Users to export</b>
<dd>This section determines which Unix users will be included in the batch
file. If you are restricted to only editing some of the users on this system,
then that restriction will apply along with any that you choose here. <p>

</dl>

The batch file created using this feature will only include basic user
details, NOT the contents of their home directories, quotas, Samba passwords
or other settings. As such, it is not a replacement for regular backups! <p>
