<header>Members</header>

The most important part of a group is the list of users who are its members.
If a user attempts to access a file and the user is a member of the group
that owns the file, then the group permissions for that file will apply. <p>

This list does not include users who have this group as their
<a href=group>primary group</a>, only users who have this as one of
their <a href=2nd>secondary groups</a>. <p>

If using a text box to enter group members, each username must be on a separate line. <p>
