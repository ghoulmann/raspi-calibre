<header>Change user ID on files?</header>

When editing an existing user, if the user's <a href=uid>User ID</a> is
changed then files owned by that user will remain owned by the old UID.
This option can be used to update the ownership on files to the new UID
by searching either the users home directory (Home Dir), or the entire
filesystem (All Files). The All Files option may take a long time,
especially if you have many large or NFS mounted filesystems.
