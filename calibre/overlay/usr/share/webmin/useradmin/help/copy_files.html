<header>Copy files to home directory?</header>

When a new user is created and this option is set, standard files like
<tt>.cshrc</tt> and <tt>.profile</tt> are copied from
<tt><exec $config{'user_files'}></tt> to the user's home directory. <p>

Selected this option will have no effect if the <a href=makehome>Create
home directory</a> option is not set as well, as there will be no home
directory to copy into. <p>
