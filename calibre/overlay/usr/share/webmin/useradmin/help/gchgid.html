<header>Change GID on files?</header>

When editing a group, if the <a href=ggid>group ID</a> is changed then
files owned by that group will remain owned by the old GID. This option
can be used to update the ownership on files to the new GID by searching
either the home directories of all users who are members of this group
(Home Directories) or the entire filesystem (All Files). The All Files
option may take a long time, especially if you have many large or NFS
mounted filesystems.
