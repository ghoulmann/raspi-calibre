<header>Account flags</header>

There are three different flags that can be set to alter password behavior:
<ul>
<li><b>Only root can change password</b><br>
    If this flag is set then only the root user can change password information. <p>
<li><b>User must choose new password</b><br>
    If this flag is set then the user is forced to change their password the
    next time a login command or an su command is given for the user.  <p>
<li><b>Don't check password restrictions</b><br>
    If this flag is set then new passwords choosen need not follow the password guidelines. <p>
</ul>
