<header>Create / modify user in other modules?</header>

If this option is set to Yes, newly created or modified users will
be updated in other Webmin modules. This allows (for example) the
Samba user list to be synchronised with the Unix user list, and for
the passwords of Webmin users to be kept in sync with Unix users. <p>
