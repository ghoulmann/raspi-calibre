<header>Home Directory</header>

A user's home directory typically contains all the files owned by that user.
When a user logs in, he will be placed in his home directory and scripts
like <tt>.cshrc</tt> or <tt>.profile</tt> will be run. <p>

When creating a new user, Webmin will create the home directory that you
enter into this field. If you change the home directory when modifying an
existing user, Webmin will attempt to rename the directory if the
<a href=movehome>Move home directory if changed?</a> option is set.
