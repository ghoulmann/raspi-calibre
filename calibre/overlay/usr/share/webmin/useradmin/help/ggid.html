<header>Group ID</header>

Like the <a href=uid>user ID</a>, the group ID or GID is what the system really
uses to enforce permissions on files and processes. If two groups have the
same GID they will be considered equivalent when it comes to checking
permissions. When creating a new group, Webmin will fill this field with 
a GID that is not in use by another group.
