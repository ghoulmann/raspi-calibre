<header>Password</header>

When a user logs in via telnet or at the console, he must normally provide a
password. There are four different options for the password :
<ul>
<if $config{'empty_mode'} == 1>
<li><b>Ask at first login</b><br>
    When the user logs in for the first time via telnet or at the console in
    text mode, the system will prompt the user for his password. <p>
</if>
<if $config{'empty_mode'} == 0>
<li><b>No password required</b><br>
    The user can login to the system without providing a password. This option
    should be used with care. <p>
</if>
<li><b>No login allowed</b><br>
    If this option is chosen the user will not be able to login to the system
    at all, even to read mail using POP3 server. <p>
<li><b>Encrypted password</b><br>
    Unix passwords are stored in a one-way encrypted form. This option allows
    you to enter the password for a user as an encrypted string (maybe taken
    from the password file on another system). <p>
<li><b>Clear text password</b><br>
    To set the password for a user, select this option and enter it into the
    text field. Webmin will take the password you enter, encrypt it and store
    it in the password file. <p>
</ul>
